Analysis scripts for Petelski & Günzel et al.; Synergistic olfactory 
processing for social plasticity in desert locusts

## Summary
Desert locust plagues threaten the food security of millions. Central to 
their formation is crowding-induced plasticity, with social phenotypes 
changing from ‘solitarious’ to ‘gregarious‘. Here, we elucidate the 
implications of this transition on foraging decisions and corresponding 
neural circuits. We used behavioral experiments and Bayesian modeling to 
decompose the multi-modal facets of foraging, revealing olfactory social 
cues as critical. To this end, we investigated how corresponding odors are 
encoded in the locust olfactory system using $in-vivo$ calcium imaging. 
We discovered crowding-dependent synergistic interactions between 
food-related and social odors distributed across stable combinatorial 
response maps. The observed synergy was specific to the gregarious phase 
and manifested in distinct odor response motifs. Our results suggest a 
crowding-induced modulation of the locust olfactory system that enhances 
food detection in swarms. Overall, we demonstrate how linking sensory 
adaptations to behaviorally relevant tasks can improve our understanding 
of social modulation in non-model organisms.

The analysis was done in MATLAB and divided for behavioural and calcium 
imaging data sets. To run the code, paths to GitHub repositories and 
data folders must be adjusted.
